kinect-projects
===============

contains sample code for Microsoft Kinect [C#]

The code in this repository, utilizes the three most basic imaging features you can get from Microft's Kinect:

*Depth data stream

*color stream

*skeletal tracking

What it is and what is it for:

The main purpose of this project is to have a reference code on how to interface with the kinect 
and easily get and utilize the data it returns you. Easily modifiable and with dynamic functions 
that can be implemented in different contexts, the program's modularity allows developers using 
this reference to only worry about further parsing data for different applications and the link
between data response and user experience. The wpf application in C# makes it easier to setup the 
GUI and dynamically link its elements to the kinect.

Future modification:

The "hand" code is yet to receive an update. Future version(s) will have a nicer GUI, a few controls,
some output analysis from the data collect from the kinect and implementation of better modular structure.
There is no expected date at this point but it will certainly be updated by the end of January, 2014.
Other cool projects will also be added.
